         <p>Hello, my name is Johnathan Martinez Pena, I was born and raised in 
            San Francisco, and I am a 3rd year at San Francisco State University who is majoring
            in Visual Communication Design. Personally, in terms of what I want to do 
            in the future, I am drawn into brand design, architecture, and interior 
            design, as those are careers into which I would like to delve into, in the future.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>In my spare time, I enjoy outdoor activities with friends, such as playing basketball, visiting
            the cinema, and exploring new locations within the city. Additionally, I have developed an interest 
            for exploring diverse cuisines and have recently involved myself within photography. In my moments of relaxation,
            I enjoy onling gaming, immersing myself in manga/manhwa, and watching Korean dramas. These 
            activities help my personal growth and offer a well-rounded balance to my academic goals. 
         </p>
