<h3>Inspiration 1: <em>Eve Harapeco</em></h3>

<p><em>Eve Harapeco</em> is a Japanese songwriter, music producer, and artist and
    is one of my favorite Japanese musicians, as not only does he make
   great music, but also, how he implements art and animations into his work
   is just amusing to see. To me, his art style, and the way he uses color in his work
   is fascinating to see as many of his <q>music videos</q> are vibrant/colorful and stand out. 
   Besides the colors, another major inspiration of his is the way how he expresses different emotions by his art too.

<h3>Inspiration 2: <em>Makoto Shinkai</em></h3>

<p><em>Makoto Shinkai</em> is a very talented director and novelist who has made many well-known animated
   films with a studio called <em>CoMix Wave Films</em>. As they have inspired me with their realistic art style,
   and enjoyable stories. I often find it amazing to see the editing process of their art, and editing process of their
   animations as well, since there is just a lot of things that come into place for it to work out.

<h3>Inspiration 3: <em>Andy Serkis</em></h3>

<img src="img/Andy Serkis Work.jpg" width="60%" Height="60%" alt="Andy Serkis's motion-capture blue character suit, Andy Serkis as Ceaser/monkey with dots on face,

<p><em>Andy Serkis</em> is an actor and filmmaker, known for his motion-capture roles in films, voicing characters
   such as <q>Ceaser</q> in <em>The Planet of the Apes</em> and <q>Gollum</q> in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>.
   His portrayal of these characters inspires me, and it was through his work that I first became familiar with
   him as an actor as well. Recognizing his work for playing these characters makes me appreciate the creativity of the
   people who are behind such films, who find ways to create realistic-looking characters.
